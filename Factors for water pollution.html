<li>Industrial waste across the world are the world are the major contributer to water pollution.</p>
<li>The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parametres.</p>
<li>The sewage waste and liquid wastes of househols, agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers. Beacause of these the plants are often died and the animals are affected by several diseases.</p>
<li>The Ganga river is the most polluted river in India followed by the river Yamuna.
<li>Water pollution is a source of various water-borne diseases like diarrhoea, intestinal worms, hepatitis and many more. Because of of these diseases over 500,000 people die worldwide every year.</p>
<li>Marine Dumping is another factor where dumping garbage into the waters of the ocean. It might seem crazy, but household garbage is still collected and dumped into oceans by many countries across the world. Most of these items can take anywhere from two to 200 years to decompose completely.</p>
<li>Oil Leaks and Spills do not dissolve in the water.Large oil spills and oil leaks, while often accidental, are a major cause of water pollution. Leaks and spills often are caused by oil drilling operations in the ocean or ships that transport oil.</p>
<li>Farmers often use chemicals and pesticides. When these substances seep into the groundwater, they can harm animals, plants and humans. Additionally, when it rains, the chemicals mix with rainwater, which then flows into rivers and streams that filter into the ocean, causing further water pollution.</p>
<li>Radioactive waste from facilities that create nuclear energy can be extremely hazardous to the environment and must be disposed of properly. This is because uranium, the element used in the creation of nuclear energy, is a highly toxic chemical.</p>
<li>Rising temperatures due to global warming are a major concern in terms of water pollution. Global warming causes water temperatures to rise, which can kill water-dwelling animals. When large die-offs occur, it further pollutes the water supply, exacerbating the issue.</p>
