<p>Water is the most important element for the preservation of life. Water is a finite commodity which, if not managed properly, will result in shortages in the near future. Water conservation can go a long way to help alleviate these impending shortages.</p>

<li><b> Check your toilet for leaks.</b>

<p>Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the bowl., you have a leak that may be wasting more than 100 gallons of water a day.</p>
<li><b>Stop using your toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket</b>

<p>Every cigarette butt or tissue you flush away also flushes away five to seven gallons of water.</p>
<li><b>Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank</b>

<p>Put an inch or two of sand or pebbles in the bottom of a one liter bottle to weigh it down. Fill the rest of the bottle with water and put it in your toilet tank, safely away from the operating mechanism. In an average home, the bottle may save five gallons or more of water every day without harming the efficiency of the toilet. If your tank is big enough, you may even be able to put in two bottles.</p>
<li><b>Take shorter showers</b>

<p>A typical shower uses five to ten gallons of water a minute. Limit your showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and rise off.</p>
<li><b>Install water-saving shower heads or flow restrictors</b>

<p>Your hardware or plumbing supply store stocks inexpensive shower heads or flow restrictors that will cut your shower flow to about three gallons a minute instead of five to ten. They are easy to install, and your showers will still be cleansing and refreshing.</p>
<li><b>Take baths</b>

  <p>A partially filled tub uses less water than all but the shortest showers.</p>
<li>Turn off the water while brushing your teeth

  <p>Before brushing, wet your brush and fill a glass for rinsing your mouth.</p>
<li>Turn off the water while shaving

  <p>Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of warm water in which to rinse your razor.</p>
<li>Check faucets and pipes for leaks

  <p>Even a small drip can waste 50 or more gallons of water a day.</p>
<li> Use your automatic dishwasher for full loads only

  <p>Every time you run your dishwasher, you use about 25 gallons of water.</p>
