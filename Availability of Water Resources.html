<li>97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps.
<li>The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air.
<li>Natural sources of fresh water include surface water, under river flow, groundwater and frozen water.
<li>Artificial sources of fresh water can include treated wastewater (reclaimed water) and desalinated seawater.
<li>Uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities.
<li>Water resources are under threat from water scarcity, water pollution, water conflict and climate change.
<li>Fresh water is a renewable resource, yet the world's supply of groundwater is steadily decreasing, with depletion occurring most prominently in Asia, South America and North America, although it is still unclear how much natural renewal balances this usage, and whether ecosystems are threatened.
<li>The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as water rights.</ul>
